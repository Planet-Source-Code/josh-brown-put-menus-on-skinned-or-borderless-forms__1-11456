## Put menus on Skinned or Borderless forms\!


</div>

### Description

Ever tried puting a menu on a form with a skin? It puts a title bar at the top. With my code you can put menus on forms that you don't want to have the regular title bars on.

I used some code from PSC on my skins.

This is really good code. Please give it a good rating and leave feedback.
